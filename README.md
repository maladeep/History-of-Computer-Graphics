Short Intro to History of Computer Graphics | Note 

# Introduction:
The term computer graphics includes almost everything on computers that is not text or sound but inside the computer the picture is stored as a series of numbers. Changing the numbers and we can change the picture, in the blink of an eye or even quicker which powers the use of computer graphics. Computer graphics as drawing pictures on computers, also called rendering.

Before going for history we must know few terms. All computer art is digital, but there are two very different ways of drawing digital images on a computer screen, known as:

1. Raster Graphic
2. Vector graphics.

# Raster Graphics (Bit map):
Building up a picture on a computer screen out of pixels is called raster graphics. They are more common in general extension such as jpg, gif, png, and are widely used on the web. A pixel is a single point or the smallest single element in a display device. If we zoom in to a raster image we start to see a lot of little tiny squares which are pixels. Mostly, we follow raster graphic technique.

# Vector Graphics:
They are created with vector software and are common for images that will be applied onto a physical product. Also used in CAD, engineering, and 3D graphic. Vector images are mathematical calculations from one point to another that form lines and shapes. If we zoom into a vector graphic it will always look the same.
